# frozen_string_literal: true

# When narrative generation failed, FitGap::Engine rescued to
# `{ culture: nil, overall: <rule-based fallback> }` and the client rendered
# `culture_narrative || overall_narrative` — so the fallback summary appeared
# under a "Culture & Competency Fit" heading with nothing indicating the AI call
# had failed. An assessor read a generated sentence as an analysis it was not.
#
# A nullable narrative cannot distinguish "failed" from "not requested", so the
# state is recorded explicitly rather than inferred from absence.
